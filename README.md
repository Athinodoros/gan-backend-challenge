# gan-backend-challenge
A server implementation for GAN's challenge in low level JS and Deno typescript

I used vanila nodeJS for the simplest and fasters implementation without being careful etc. But still works :) 

I did spend a bit more time in Deno as I thought it was more fun. 

### Run deno server 

To run the deno part you need to install the Deno runtime from [here](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/getting_started/installation) it is super fast and easy. Why did I use Deno you ask? For fun and experience. I have been using node for so long, that it gets kinda borring doing challenges in nodeJS... 

# now that you have deno installed you can run the tests running the following command :

`deno task test` inside the deno-server directory 

# and the server with 

`demo task dev` 

I will not add instructions for node I hope it is ok :P 

Emjoy!
